    ## # ℹ 348 more rows
    ## # ℹ 5 more variables: wind_gust <dbl>, precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>,

``` r
n_row = nrow(early_january_weather) #calculates number of rows
n_col = ncol(early_january_weather) #calculates number of columns
mean_temp = mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp)) #calculates the mean of the temperature column
```

The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. he dataset contains the
following variables: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid,
wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The
important variables are: `temp`: temperature in Ferenheit `month`: 1
(January) `year`: 2013 `humid`: humidity The mean temperature is
39.5821229 degrees Ferenheit.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x= time_hour, y = temp, color= humid)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Hour Colored by Humidity", 
       x = "Hour in January",
       y = "Temperature in Farenheit")

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

From January 1st through Janurary 14th,, Temperatures rise in the day
and drop at night. As January progresses (after January 7th),
temperature rises overall through the day for both morning, afternoons,
and nights compared to before January 7th. Humidity is higher after
January 7th than before January 7th.

## Problem 2

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
num = rnorm(10),            
logical = num > 0,          
char=  letters[1:10],            
factor = factor(sample(c("Small", "Medium", "Large"), 10, replace = TRUE))
)

#The following lines of codes calculates the mean of the variables we created. 
mean(pull(df, num))        
```

    ## [1] 0.3464362

``` r
mean(pull(df, logical))    
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
mean(pull(df, char))          
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, factor))  
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Cannot take the mean of a character or factor. We were able to take the
mean of numeric and logical variables.

``` r
#The following lines of codes converts the variable to numeric.
as.numeric(pull(df, logical)) 
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, char)) 
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, factor)) 
```

    ##  [1] 1 3 3 1 1 3 2 2 2 2

For logical vectors, TRUE values are converted to 1 and FALSE values are
converted to 0. This makes sense because R internally stores logicals as
binary values. Taking the mean of a logical vector works because it
gives the proportion of TRUEs. This does not work for character vectors
and we get NA values with a warning because arbitrary characters cannot
be meaningfully mapped to numbers. As a result, the mean cannot be
calculated.Lastly, for the factor, we see the values that the factor
interanally stores the levels as. For example, the first level is coded
as 1, the second as 2, and so on. as.numeric() reveals those codes.
While we can technically compute a mean of these numbers, it is not
meaningful because the numeric codes don’t represent real quantitative
values. This helps explain why the mean function only gives us a
meaningful output for the numerical and logical values, and why it does
not give us anything for the character and factor values.
